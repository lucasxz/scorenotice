    <p class="q">Where is Score?</p>
    <p class="a"> Gone. The Synergy app that the district uses has had a major update (as you've all noticed) and this completely changes how Score needs to get your grades. It also doesn't help that Mcklyde stopped paying for the server.</p>

    <p class="q">When will it be back?</p>
    <p class="a"> The project has been transferred to a new team over the summer. I will no longer be working on this project and it will be rebranded to `Mosachi` by some weeb named Mcklyde. As for when the new site will be up, I really have no clue. They've been working on it for a few months now and this is honestly a 2 week project at most (Mcklyde says it's Elliot's fault but u can't trust a weeb).</p>

    <p class="q">How can I help?</p>
    <p class="a">If you donate enough money to me I'll remake score lol. But it also depends on whether or not Mr. Vandyke stops assigning 2 hours of calc homework every night. Mcklyde also wants cash but im too lazy to make another button so venmo him at @Titorthegod</p>

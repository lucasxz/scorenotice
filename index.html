    <p class="q">Where is Score?</p>
    <p class="a"> Gone. The Synergy app that the district uses has had a major update (as you've all noticed) and this completely changes how Score needs to get your grades. It also doesn't help that Mcklyde stopped paying for the server.</p>

    <p class="q">When will it be back?</p>
    <p class="a"> Ask Elliot Gluck why Mosachi isn't working. McKlyde is the best programmer</p>

    <p class="q">How can I help?</p>
    <p class="a">Venmo mcklyde @ TitorTheGod Also please tell vandyke to make Lucas grade an A thanks.</p>
